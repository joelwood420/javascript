function shouldBringSnacks(isLongTrip, childIsHungry, justAteLunch) {
    // If the child just ate lunch, no snacks needed regardless of other conditions
    if (justAteLunch) {
        return false;
    }

    // Bring snacks if either the trip is long OR the child is hungry
    if (isLongTrip || childIsHungry) {
        return true;
    }
    
    // If none of the above conditions are met, no snacks needed
    return false;
}

// Test cases
console.log(shouldBringSnacks(true, false, false)); 
console.log(shouldBringSnacks(false, true, false)); 
console.log(shouldBringSnacks(true, true, true));   
console.log(shouldBringSnacks(false, false, false));


my approach was to add a parameter tripHours and then define isLongTrip based on that parameter. However, since the original function already has isLongTrip as a parameter, I reverted to using it directly. The function now correctly implements the logic to decide whether to bring snacks based on the given conditions.







// Function that determines if an extra blanket is needed based on two conditions
function needsExtraBlanket(childFeelsCold, busHasAC) {
    // Check if either the child feels cold OR the bus has AC running
    if (childFeelsCold || busHasAC) {
        // If either condition is true, we need an extra blanket
        return true;
    }
    // If neither the child is cold nor the bus has AC, no extra blanket is needed
    return false;
}

// Test case 1: Both conditions are true (child is cold AND bus has AC)
console.log(needsExtraBlanket(true, true));   // true
// Test case 2: Child is cold but bus has no AC
console.log(needsExtraBlanket(true, false));  // true
// Test case 3: Child isn't cold but bus has AC
console.log(needsExtraBlanket(false, true));  // true
// Test case 4: Neither child is cold nor bus has AC
console.log(needsExtraBlanket(false, false)); // false


my approach here to create this fuction was to use a simple if statement that checks if either of the two conditions is true. If either condition is true, the function returns true, indicating that an extra blanket is needed. If both conditions are false, it returns false, indicating that no extra blanket is needed. This approach effectively captures the logic required for the decision-making process regarding the need for an extra blanket.
