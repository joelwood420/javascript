made a small error in my first approach, here is the corrected version:


function largestOf3(number1, number2, number3) {
// Check if the first number is greater than or equal to the other two
if (number1 >= number2 && number1 >= number3) {
return number1; // Return the first number if it is the largest
} else if (number2 >= number1 && number2 >= number3) { // Check if the second number is greater than or equal to the other two
return number2; // Return the second number if it is the largest
} else {
return number3; // Return the third number if it is the largest
}
}

// Test the function with three numbers and log the result
console.log(largestOf3(5, 10, 3));

my approach was to first check if the first number is greater than or equal to the other two numbers. If it is return that number. If not, check if the second number is greater than or equal to the other two numbers. If it is, return that number. If neither of those conditions are true, I return the third number as it must be the largest.



My Second approach.

function largestOf3(number1, number2, number3) {
let largest = number1; // first create a variable to hold the largest number, assign number1 to it.
if (number2 > largest) { // Compare the second number with the current largest
	largest = number2; // reassign number2 to largest if the second number is greater
}
if (number3 > largest) { // Compare the third number with the current largest
	largest = number3; // Update largest if the third number is greater
}
return largest; // Return the largest number found
}

console.log(largestOf3(5, 10, 3)); // Test the function with three numbers and log the result

my second approach was to first create a variable to hold the largest number, starting with the first number. Then I compared the second number with the current largest, and if it was greater, I reassigned that value to the largest variable. I repeated that process for the third number. Finally, I returned the largest number found.
