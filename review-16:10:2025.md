// Function to determine if someone can watch TV
function canWatchTv(isHoliday, isWeekday){ 
    // Return true if it's a holiday or not a weekday
    return(isHoliday || !isWeekday )
}

// Log the result of canWatchTv 
console.log(canWatchTv(false, true))


// My approach to this function was to use the OR operator to check if it's a holiday or not a weekday.
// I used a simple return statement with the condition to return true or false based on the inputs.





// Function to check if both partners agree
function doTheyAgree(partner1Decision, partner2Decision){
    // Return true if both decisions are the same
    return(partner1Decision === partner2Decision)
}

// Log the result of doTheyAgree 
console.log(doTheyAgree(false, true))


// My approach to this function was to use the strict equality operator to check if both partners made the same decision.
// I used a simple return statement with the condition to return true or false based on the input.



// Function to check if something is open based on weekday and month
function isOpen(weekday, month){
    // Return true if it's not Monday and not July
    return(weekday != "monday" && month != "july" )
}

// Log the result of isOpen 
console.log(isOpen("tuesday", "july"))

// My approach to this function was to use the AND operator to check if it's not Monday and not July.
// Again I used a simple return statement with the condition to return true or false based on the inputs..
